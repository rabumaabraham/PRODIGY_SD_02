# Guessing Game Application

This is a fun and interactive Guess the Number game built using Python and Tkinter, developed during my software development internship at Prodigy Infotech. In this game, the program generates a random number between 1 and 10, and the user is challenged to guess it. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low and continues until the user guesses correctly. The application also tracks and displays the number of attempts it took to guess the correct number.
